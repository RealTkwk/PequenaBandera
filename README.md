# PequenaBandera

Pequeña Bandera is a website based on an idea my brother had. It's also my first try at Web Development with a Python framework, Django in this case. It's currently running on Heroku, you can visit at www.PequeñaBandera.com.ar

The site is focused towards reminding its users when to wear the Argentine national cockade. It is currently using a third party service to send notifications via Chrome (desktop and Android), iOs and Firefox notifications. As a small addition there's a page where the users can check a small list of all national holidays where the conmemorative pin should be used and the closest one.

It will be running for aproximately a year and after that the code can be visited here in case someone else wants to keep it running.
